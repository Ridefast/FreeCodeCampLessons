FreeCodeCamp Lessons

Here I am going to Post all the correct results from the FreeCodeCamp Lessons. 

I'm completely new to Programming so this should be a little Help for anyone that will take the same Path as I do.

There are Lessons where you have to make something like an unsorted list. There my Code can be different from the one on Codecamp. Unfortunately, the Code gets reset on different Lessons. Since Iâ€™m making my Coding in Notepad++ mine stays always the same. Either ways you will pass the Test.
